# Notes for my implementation of a CRUDdy app.

  - starting with basic framework, build upon the web app using local storage
  - make it resemble the kind of format as an old java or flash game.
  - windowed area where creature will live
  - side menu that displays current creature stats
  - unable to add fetures until they are given access through evolution
  - or, other fetures are provided through in-game currency
  - examples of small-box game-window style

## Designs
  - tomagachi-like app with screen images and sprites.
    > Will need to implement animation
    > sounds?
    > animate images vs color boxes
    > embedded music?
    > sound fx?
    > loading screen
    > currency to spend on food / toys

### Fetures
  - Local storage web-animal
    > Persistent creature attributes
      - hunger
      - happiness
      - energy
      - play
      - response
      - age / evolution
      - health
      - size
      - birth / death

    > Colorful user-interface
      - dynamic background

    > Time decaying atributes.
      - stages of growth
      - hunger / requiring the need for attention
      - 

    > Time generating attributes
      - in-game currency
      - relative creature age
      - creature evolution
